Topic 1 : Predicting Parking Spot Availability<br/>
1. Introduction <br/>
Parking, especially in the Bay area is a problem that anyone who has a car almost inevitably faces. Finding a parking lot is a hassle but finding an available slot in a parking lot is just as challenging. This project aims to provide users with more information on available slots so as to prevent them spending their time on the menial job of hunting for places to park their car. 

2. Abstract <br/>
We intend to analyze available datasets to predict how many slots are generally available for a parking lot during a certain time of the day. BY analyzing public datasets from Lyft's Baywheel cycles, we hope to provide a better context for when slots will be available and help users in easing the headache of finding spots for parking. In order to collect real-world data, we plan to create an interface for parking lot maintainers and users to modify information related to the number of parking lots available, and when slots are typically filled and are empty. 

2. Approach <br/>
We currently intend to analyze the public dataset offered by Bay Wheels. Once the data is crunched, we expect to predict for a certain parking lot, how many slots are generally available. An interface offered to users will consist of a web application. 


4. Persona <br/>
We are expecting users who want to avail parking lots and parking lot maintainers who want to rent spaces in their parking lots to use the application.

Topic 2: Predicting Instagram Influencers’ Popularity

1. Introduction </br>
Social media marketing can play a very important role in promoting a product or a service. A marketer may want to decide between a set of available influncers for their marketing campaigns. They can benefit more by collaboarating with an influencer with more reach and popularity. <br/>
An Instagram influencer is someone who’s built a reputation around a certain niche on Instagram. They are essentially a brand ambassador for your business.<br/>
According to HypeAuditor’s State of Influencer Marketing 2021 report, the Instagram influencer market is expected to grow 15% in 2021, reaching a market cap of $5.8 billion by the end of the year.<br/>

2. Abstract <br/>
We intend to analyze the past data of top Instagram influencers in India and predict whether their popularity will grow or decline in the future.<br/>

3. Approach <br/>
We will retrieve the Instagram influencers data from Starngage website.<br/>
We will preprocess that data and use machine learning alogirthms to predict their popularity. <br/>

4. Persona <br/>
This model can be used by a marketer to decide which Instagram influencer will be more popular in future based on the predicted popularity, they can then collaborate with those influencers to increase their outreach and get a better return on their social media marketing investment. <br/>

Topic 3: News Recommendation System Using NER<br/>

Introduction to the problem statement<br/>
The recommendation system dominates how we discover new content and ideas in today's world. This is a proven approach for news publishers to recommend relevant articles and ads to their readers. This approach can be used to make the articles more engaging for the readers. Such recommendations can be generated by using Named Entity Recognition on the news articles.

Abstract<br/>
Extract named entities from different news articles using the Spacy library in python, then use a machine-learning algorithm to match different articles and look for similarities. Then generate recommendations based on the similarities for each article. 

Approach<br/>
Bloomberg News API will be used for the input news feed data. This data will be passed through the Named Entity Recognizer to extract and generate a set of named entities for each article. The extracted named entities set can then be processed by a machine-learning algorithm to find similarities and generate recommendations for each article.
The articles with recommendation will be displayed to the user along with tags for each article.

Persona<br/>
News article readers.
