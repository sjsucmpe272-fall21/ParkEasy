<hr style="border:2px solid gray"> </hr>

1. Introduction <br/>
Parking, especially in the Bay area is a problem that anyone who has a vehicle almost inevitably faces. Finding a parking lot is a hassle and finding an available slot in a parking lot is even more challenging. Its high time we think of a better parking solution that will allow users to save their valuable time and money.

2. Abstract <br/>
What if we provide a way for people to rent their parking spots? People in Bay area do commute everyday from one place to another. We intend to solve the problem of parking spot availability by allowing users to list their private parking spaces as available and providing the same to someone who is looking for the parking space in the same area. By sharing their private parking spaces, the users can get monetory benefits and at the same help us solve the parking issue in Bay Area. Further,we intend to analyze the data generated by our solution and also external datasets to predict how many slots and which locations parking spots are available during a certain time of the day.  

3. Approach <br/>
We plan to create a distributed web application that will allow owners of the parking spaces to rent their private parking spaces for how much ever time they want. Users of the application can pay and book such parking slots that are listed on the website. </br>
We also intend to analyze the dataset generated by our solution and external datasets like the one offered by Bay Wheels to predict parking spot availabiltiy.


4. Persona <br/>
We have identified two user personas.</br>
1:Owners of the parking space, who can list their private parking spaces as available.</br>
2:Users of the application, who are looking for parking spaces.</br>
